# Verta User Migration Guide

This guide provides an overview of the new features and changes in the Verta application.

## Dark Theme

The application now uses a dark theme by default, which provides a more modern and visually appealing experience. The dark theme is designed to be easy on the eyes, especially in low-light environments.

## Purple Accent

The primary accent color of the application is now purple. This color is used for interactive elements, such as buttons and links, to provide a clear visual hierarchy.

## High-Contrast Mode

For users who prefer a higher level of contrast, the application now includes a high-contrast mode. This mode can be enabled by clicking the contrast toggle button in the header.

## Keyboard Navigation

The application now has improved keyboard navigation. Users can navigate through the application using the tab key, and can interact with elements using the enter and space keys. The channel list and thread view also have their own specific keyboard navigation features.
