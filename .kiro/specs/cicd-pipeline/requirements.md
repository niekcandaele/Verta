# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Verta project currently lacks automated CI/CD processes, requiring manual builds, testing, and deployment. This creates risks of deploying broken code, inconsistent container images, and increases the time and effort required for releases. We need an automated pipeline that validates code quality, runs tests, and builds/publishes Docker containers for all services.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Automated Quality Checks

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated quality checks on every code push, so that I can catch errors early and maintain code quality standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is pushed to any branch THEN the system SHALL run builds for all workspaces (backend, frontend, shared-types)
2. WHEN code changes are detected THEN the system SHALL execute linting (ESLint for JS/TS, Next.js lint for frontend)
3. WHEN the backend workspace has tests THEN the system SHALL run test suites using Vitest
4. IF any quality check fails THEN the pipeline SHALL fail and prevent merging
5. WHEN a pull request is created THEN the system SHALL display check status on the PR

### Requirement 2: Automated Docker Image Building

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want Docker images automatically built for all services, so that I have consistent, ready-to-deploy artifacts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN quality checks pass THEN the system SHALL build Docker images for backend, frontend, and python-ml-service
2. WHEN building images THEN the system SHALL use multi-stage builds for optimization
3. WHEN building the Python service THEN the system SHALL download required ML models during build
4. WHEN building images THEN the system SHALL target linux/amd64 architecture
5. WHEN builds complete THEN the system SHALL provide build summaries and status

### Requirement 3: Container Registry Publishing

**User Story:** As a deployment engineer, I want Docker images automatically published to a container registry, so that I can pull pre-built images for deployment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Docker images are built successfully THEN the system SHALL push them to GitHub Container Registry (ghcr.io)
2. WHEN publishing images THEN they SHALL be made publicly accessible without authentication
3. WHEN images are published THEN they SHALL be under the user namespace (ghcr.io/username/verta-*)
4. IF registry push fails THEN the system SHALL report the error clearly
5. WHEN images are published THEN the system SHALL display the image tags and URLs

### Requirement 4: Intelligent Image Tagging

**User Story:** As a release manager, I want Docker images tagged based on their source, so that I can easily identify and deploy the correct version.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is pushed to a branch THEN images SHALL be tagged with the sanitized branch name
2. WHEN a pull request is created THEN images SHALL be tagged with pr-<number>
3. WHEN a git tag matching v*.*.* is pushed THEN images SHALL be tagged with the version
4. WHEN pushing to the main branch THEN images SHALL also be tagged as 'latest'
5. WHEN multiple tags apply THEN the system SHALL push all applicable tags

### Requirement 5: Manual Workflow Control

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to manually trigger CI/CD workflows with custom options, so that I can test builds or create custom releases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the Actions tab THEN users SHALL see a "Run workflow" button for manual dispatch
2. WHEN triggering manually THEN users SHALL be able to choose whether to push images
3. WHEN triggering manually THEN users SHALL be able to specify a custom image tag
4. WHEN a manual run is triggered THEN it SHALL follow the same quality checks as automated runs
5. WHEN manual dispatch is used THEN the run SHALL be clearly labeled in the UI

### Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Performance:** The complete pipeline SHALL execute within 15 minutes for typical changes
2. **Security:** Container registry credentials SHALL be managed securely using GitHub secrets
3. **Reliability:** The pipeline SHALL be idempotent and produce consistent results
4. **Usability:** Pipeline failures SHALL provide clear, actionable error messages
5. **Efficiency:** The system SHALL use caching to optimize build times
6. **Concurrency:** The system SHALL cancel redundant runs when new commits are pushed
