# OCR Integration Tasks

## Overview
Add OCR capabilities to extract text from image attachments in Discord messages. Enhances question detection and clustering by including text from screenshots and diagrams.

## Phase 1: ML Service OCR Foundation ✅
**Goal**: Set up OCR model in ML service with working endpoint

### Completed Tasks
- ✅ Install OpenRouter dependencies in ML service
- ✅ Create OpenRouter OCR model wrapper
- ✅ Implement OCR endpoints (/ocr and /ocr/batch)
- ✅ Add OCR model to app initialization
- ✅ Test OCR with sample images

## Phase 2: Database Schema ✅
**Goal**: Create versioned storage for OCR results

### Completed Tasks
- ✅ Create ocr_results table migration
- ✅ Update Database types with OCR tables
- ✅ Create OcrResultRepository
- ✅ Add cascade delete constraints
- ✅ Clean orphaned records

## Phase 3: Backend Integration ✅
**Goal**: Connect backend to ML service OCR endpoint

### Completed Tasks
- ✅ Add OCR types to MlClientService
- ✅ Implement OCR client methods
- ✅ Add circuit breaker for OCR calls
- ✅ Create integration tests
- ✅ Update service configuration

## Phase 4: Queue Processing ✅
**Goal**: Process images asynchronously via job queue

### Completed Tasks
- ✅ Create OCR job queue definition
- ✅ Implement OCR worker
- ✅ Queue OCR during message sync
- ✅ Add retry logic for failures
- ✅ Implement batch processing (2000 per cycle)

## Phase 5: Question Processing Integration ✅
**Goal**: Combine OCR text with message content

### Completed Tasks
- ✅ Fetch OCR results for messages
- ✅ Combine message and OCR text
- ✅ Update classification to use combined text
- ✅ Test with image-heavy threads
- ✅ Add help channel context to prompts

## Phase 6: Monitoring and Operations ✅
**Goal**: Ensure reliable OCR processing

### Completed Tasks
- ✅ Add OCR retry scheduler (hourly)
- ✅ Queue missing OCR jobs automatically
- ✅ Consolidate workers to prevent conflicts
- ✅ BullBoard integration for monitoring
- ✅ Add structured logging for metrics

## Implementation Notes

### Key Decisions
- Switched from EasyOCR to OpenRouter free vision models (better accuracy, easier deployment)
- Consolidated OcrRetryWorker into OcrWorker (prevents job conflicts)
- Increased batch size from 50 to 2000 (faster processing)
- Added help channel context to OCR prompts (more relevant extractions)

### Performance Metrics
- Processing ~5,465 images across system
- Average OCR time: 4-7 seconds per image
- Retry success rate: ~95% after 3 attempts
- Batch processing: 2000 images per retry cycle

### Lessons Learned
- Date comparison in Kysely requires type casting
- Worker consolidation prevents queue conflicts
- Cascade deletes essential for data integrity
- Visual context improves troubleshooting assistance
