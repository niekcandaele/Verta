There's weird stuff going on with the dates. Everything is last seen 'today'. These msgs are older! Using wrong timestamp column?
Everything has 100% confidence? That seems odd. With my human eyes and brain I do see stuff that is clustered which isnt 100% the same!
All of the buttons (like 'Add answer', 'Back to Clusters', 'Cancel' and 'Save Answer') have a icon and some text, but they are not aligned properly at all!

The text input for golden answer is white which really stands out against the dark theme.
The text inside the text input for golder answer is light gray, barely readable!

We also need a way to edit the Representative text in the FAQ

'Thread title' doesnt make sense to show as you do now, there's multiple threads linked to each answer!
