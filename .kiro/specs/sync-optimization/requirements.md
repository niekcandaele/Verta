# Sync Process Optimization Requirements

## Introduction

The current Discord sync process performs sequential scanning of channels and messages, resulting in slow sync times especially for large servers. This feature aims to optimize the sync process by introducing parallelization and maximizing API efficiency while respecting Discord's rate limits.

## User Stories

### As a tenant administrator
- I want the sync process to complete faster
- So that my users can see up-to-date content without long delays

### As a system operator
- I want the sync process to maximize throughput
- So that we can handle more tenants efficiently

### As a developer
- I want the sync process to respect rate limits
- So that our bot doesn't get banned or throttled

## Acceptance Criteria

### Performance Requirements

1. The system SHALL process multiple channels in parallel during sync operations
2. WHEN syncing messages, the system SHALL use the maximum page size allowed by Discord (100 messages)
3. The system SHALL maintain a configurable concurrency limit for parallel operations
4. WHEN rate limits are encountered, the system SHALL gracefully back off and retry

### Reliability Requirements

5. The system SHALL NOT lose or skip messages during parallel processing
6. The system SHALL maintain sync progress for each channel independently
7. IF a channel sync fails, THEN the system SHALL NOT affect other channel syncs
8. The system SHALL provide detailed progress reporting during sync operations

### Configuration Requirements

9. The system SHALL allow configuration of parallelization parameters:
   - Maximum concurrent channel syncs
   - Message fetch batch size
   - Rate limit retry strategy
10. The system SHALL provide sensible defaults that work for most Discord servers

### Monitoring Requirements

11. The system SHALL track sync performance metrics:
    - Time per channel
    - Messages per second
    - Rate limit encounters
12. The system SHALL provide detailed error reporting for failed syncs

## Technical Constraints

- Must work within Discord API rate limits (50 requests per second)
- Must handle both incremental and full sync types
- Must support all channel types (text, thread, forum)
- Must maintain message ordering within channels
- Must handle large servers with 500+ channels efficiently

## Success Metrics

- Sync time reduction of at least 50% for servers with 100+ channels
- No increase in error rates compared to sequential sync
- Memory usage remains under control during parallel operations
