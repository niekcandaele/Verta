# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Discord Bot Autoresponder feature enhances Verta's Discord integration by adding interactive bot capabilities. Currently, Verta only syncs Discord messages for search but lacks real-time interaction. This feature adds automatic thread responses and slash commands to provide immediate assistance to users within Discord, leveraging the existing search and ML services to generate contextual, helpful responses.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a Discord user, I want the bot to automatically respond when I create a new thread in monitored channels, so that I get immediate assistance without leaving Discord.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new thread is created in an admin-configured channel THEN the system SHALL detect the thread creation event
2. WHEN a thread is detected THEN the system SHALL wait 10 seconds to gather additional context messages
3. IF new messages are added during the 10-second window THEN the system SHALL reset the timer
4. WHEN the timer expires THEN the system SHALL analyze all thread messages and generate a response
5. WHEN generating a response THEN the system SHALL execute 2-3 search queries to gather comprehensive context
6. WHEN search results are gathered THEN the system SHALL use Gemini Flash to synthesize a natural language response
7. WHEN posting the response THEN the system SHALL include confidence level and source links

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a Discord user, I want to use slash commands to ask questions on-demand, so that I can get help even in existing conversations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user types `/ask [question]` THEN the system SHALL receive the interaction event
2. IF the command is used in a thread THEN the system SHALL include the last 20 thread messages as context
3. IF the command is used in a channel THEN the system SHALL process the question without channel context
4. WHEN processing the command THEN the system SHALL defer the reply to handle long processing times
5. WHEN generating a response THEN the system SHALL prioritize golden answers over general search results
6. WHEN responding in a channel THEN the system SHALL use ephemeral replies to avoid spam
7. WHEN responding in a thread THEN the system SHALL use public replies for visibility

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a Discord user, I want a help command to understand how to use the bot effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user types `/help` THEN the system SHALL display usage instructions
2. WHEN displaying help THEN the system SHALL use ephemeral messages
3. WHEN help is shown THEN the system SHALL include examples of how to use `/ask`
4. WHEN help is shown THEN the system SHALL explain the automatic thread response feature

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to configure which channels the bot monitors, so that I can control where automatic responses occur.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the admin panel THEN administrators SHALL see a bot configuration section
2. WHEN configuring the bot THEN administrators SHALL be able to select monitored channels
3. WHEN channels are selected THEN the system SHALL validate bot permissions in those channels
4. WHEN configuration is saved THEN the system SHALL immediately apply the new settings
5. IF the bot lacks permissions in a channel THEN the system SHALL display a warning

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want the bot to handle high load gracefully, so that it remains responsive during busy periods.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple events occur simultaneously THEN the system SHALL queue them for processing
2. WHEN processing queued events THEN the system SHALL use rate limiting to respect Discord API limits
3. IF the search service is unavailable THEN the system SHALL respond with a friendly error message
4. IF response generation fails THEN the system SHALL log the error and notify the user
5. WHEN under load THEN the system SHALL maintain sub-5-second response times for 95% of queries

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the bot to integrate seamlessly with existing infrastructure, so that we maintain system consistency.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN initializing the bot THEN the system SHALL use the existing Discord.js client from DiscordClientManager
2. WHEN the bot starts THEN the system SHALL register required intents for threads and interactions
3. WHEN processing events THEN the system SHALL use the existing queue infrastructure (BullMQ)
4. WHEN searching THEN the system SHALL use the existing SearchService with multi-query support
5. WHEN generating responses THEN the system SHALL use the existing ML service
6. WHEN storing configuration THEN the system SHALL follow existing repository patterns
