# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature transforms the existing system into a multi-tenant architecture with secure CRUD API routes for tenant management. The system will support multiple platforms (Slack and Discord) with proper authentication, data validation, and PostgreSQL storage using Kysely ORM.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to manage tenants through secure API endpoints, so that I can control access and organize users by their respective organizations or groups.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an API request is made to tenant endpoints THEN the system SHALL validate the X-API-KEY header against the configured environment variable
2. IF the X-API-KEY header is missing or invalid THEN the system SHALL return a 401 Unauthorized response
3. WHEN a valid API key is provided THEN the system SHALL allow access to tenant management operations

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to create new tenants with complete information, so that I can onboard new organizations to the platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a POST request is made to create a tenant THEN the system SHALL validate all required fields using Zod schema
2. WHEN creating a tenant THEN the system SHALL automatically generate a unique ID and set createdAt timestamp
3. WHEN a tenant is created successfully THEN the system SHALL return the complete tenant object with a 201 status
4. IF required fields are missing or invalid THEN the system SHALL return a 400 Bad Request with validation errors

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to retrieve tenant information, so that I can view and monitor tenant details.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a GET request is made to retrieve all tenants THEN the system SHALL return a paginated list of all tenants
2. WHEN a GET request is made with a specific tenant ID THEN the system SHALL return the complete tenant information
3. IF a tenant ID does not exist THEN the system SHALL return a 404 Not Found response
4. WHEN retrieving tenants THEN the system SHALL include all tenant fields (id, name, createdAt, updatedAt, status, platform, platformId, slug)

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to update tenant information, so that I can modify tenant details as requirements change.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a PUT/PATCH request is made to update a tenant THEN the system SHALL validate the updated fields using Zod schema
2. WHEN a tenant is updated successfully THEN the system SHALL automatically update the updatedAt timestamp
3. WHEN a tenant is updated THEN the system SHALL return the updated tenant object
4. IF the tenant ID does not exist THEN the system SHALL return a 404 Not Found response
5. IF validation fails THEN the system SHALL return a 400 Bad Request with validation errors

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to delete tenants, so that I can remove organizations that are no longer using the platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a DELETE request is made with a valid tenant ID THEN the system SHALL remove the tenant from the database
2. WHEN a tenant is deleted successfully THEN the system SHALL return a 204 No Content response
3. IF the tenant ID does not exist THEN the system SHALL return a 404 Not Found response

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want tenants to have proper status management, so that I can control tenant access and maintenance states.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating or updating a tenant THEN the system SHALL validate that status is one of: ACTIVE, CANCELLED, MAINTENANCE
2. WHEN a new tenant is created without specifying status THEN the system SHALL default the status to ACTIVE
3. WHEN retrieving tenants THEN the system SHALL include the current status in the response

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to support multiple platforms, so that tenants can use either Slack or Discord integrations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating or updating a tenant THEN the system SHALL validate that platform is either "slack" or "discord"
2. WHEN platform is "discord" THEN the system SHALL require a valid Discord guild ID in platformId field
3. WHEN platform is "slack" THEN the system SHALL require a valid Slack workspace identifier in platformId field
4. WHEN creating a tenant THEN the system SHALL ensure platformId is unique within the same platform type

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want tenants to have unique slugs, so that they can be easily identified and referenced in URLs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating a tenant THEN the system SHALL validate that the slug is unique across all tenants
2. WHEN creating a tenant THEN the system SHALL validate that the slug contains only lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens
3. IF a slug is not provided THEN the system SHALL generate one based on the tenant name
4. WHEN updating a tenant slug THEN the system SHALL ensure the new slug remains unique

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to use PostgreSQL with Kysely ORM, so that tenant data is stored reliably with type-safe database operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL connect to PostgreSQL database using Kysely
2. WHEN performing database operations THEN the system SHALL use Kysely's type-safe query builder
3. WHEN the database schema changes THEN the system SHALL support migrations through Kysely
4. WHEN storing tenant data THEN the system SHALL use proper PostgreSQL data types for each field

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive input validation using Zod, so that all API requests are properly validated before processing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any tenant API endpoint receives a request THEN the system SHALL validate the request body using Zod schemas
2. WHEN validation fails THEN the system SHALL return detailed error messages indicating which fields are invalid
3. WHEN validation succeeds THEN the system SHALL proceed with the requested operation
4. WHEN defining validation schemas THEN the system SHALL include all business rules and constraints
