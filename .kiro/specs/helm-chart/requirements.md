# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Helm Chart feature provides a production-ready Kubernetes deployment solution for the Verta application. Currently, Verta uses Docker Compose for local development but lacks proper Kubernetes manifests for production deployments. This Helm chart enables scalable, configurable deployments across different environments with proper secrets management, resource allocation, and monitoring integration.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want to deploy all Verta services with a single command, so that I can quickly set up new environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running `helm install verta ./charts/verta` THEN the system SHALL deploy backend, frontend, and ML services
2. WHEN deploying services THEN the system SHALL configure them to communicate using Kubernetes DNS
3. WHEN services start THEN they SHALL be able to connect to Redis and external TiDB
4. WHEN deployment completes THEN all pods SHALL pass health checks and be ready
5. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages about missing configuration

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want to manage different environments with the same chart, so that I maintain consistency across deployments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying to development THEN the system SHALL use minimal resource allocations via values-dev.yaml
2. WHEN deploying to production THEN the system SHALL use HA configuration via values-prod.yaml
3. WHEN switching environments THEN only values files SHALL need to change, not templates
4. WHEN using environment-specific values THEN they SHALL override default values.yaml
5. WHEN validating configuration THEN the system SHALL support dry-run mode

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a security engineer, I want secrets managed separately from configuration, so that sensitive data is protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN defining secrets THEN they SHALL be passed through Helm values, not hardcoded
2. WHEN creating Kubernetes secrets THEN they SHALL be base64 encoded automatically
3. WHEN mounting secrets THEN they SHALL be available as environment variables to pods
4. WHEN displaying secrets THEN Helm SHALL not log them during install/upgrade
5. WHEN storing secrets THEN they SHALL include database URLs, API keys, and tokens

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a platform engineer, I want services to scale automatically based on load, so that the application handles traffic spikes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN CPU usage exceeds 70% THEN the system SHALL create additional pod replicas
2. WHEN creating replicas THEN the system SHALL respect minimum (1) and maximum (10) limits
3. WHEN load decreases THEN the system SHALL scale down gradually to avoid thrashing
4. WHEN scaling THEN the system SHALL maintain service availability via PodDisruptionBudgets
5. WHEN configuring scaling THEN each service SHALL have independent HPA settings

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a database administrator, I want migrations to run before the application starts, so that schema is always current.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN backend pods start THEN init containers SHALL run database migrations first
2. WHEN migrations fail THEN the main container SHALL not start
3. WHEN multiple replicas start THEN only one SHALL run migrations (via Jobs or leader election)
4. WHEN migrations complete THEN logs SHALL be available for troubleshooting
5. WHEN rolling back THEN migrations SHALL not automatically reverse

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the chart to integrate with existing Docker images, so that we maintain a single build pipeline.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying THEN the chart SHALL use images from ghcr.io/niekcandaele/verta-*
2. WHEN specifying versions THEN image tags SHALL be configurable via values
3. WHEN pulling images THEN the system SHALL support private registry authentication
4. WHEN images update THEN the chart SHALL support rolling updates
5. WHEN using latest tag THEN the system SHALL pull new images on upgrade

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a site reliability engineer, I want comprehensive monitoring and observability, so that I can maintain system health.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN pods run THEN they SHALL expose health check endpoints
2. WHEN health checks fail THEN Kubernetes SHALL restart unhealthy pods
3. WHEN deploying THEN the chart SHALL include resource requests and limits
4. WHEN incidents occur THEN pod logs SHALL be easily accessible
5. WHEN monitoring THEN the system SHALL expose metrics for Prometheus scraping
